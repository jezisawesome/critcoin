# CritCoin Overview ðŸŽ²  

## Unlock Mechanism Details  
- **5 d20 dice:** Each dice roll has a 1/20 chance of hitting a natural 20.  
- **Randomness Source:** Solanaâ€™s blockhash is used as the seed for generating pseudo-random dice rolls.  

### Unlock Tiers

| 3 natural 20s      | 3%                              | 12M tokens                            |

| 5 natural 20s      | 100%                            | Remaining balance unlocked           |  

## Security Considerations  
- **Transparency:** All dice rolls are logged on-chain, and token unlocks are auditable.  
- **Manual Controls:** The unlocked tokens are transferred to a designated wallet, allowing manual management to avoid large sell-offs.
